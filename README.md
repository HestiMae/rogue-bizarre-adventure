# Robyn's Bizarre Adventure
A strange dinosaur game built in a rogue-esque CLI game engine.

I made this for a unit in Object Oriented Design - It's a TUI/CLI game with a few twists and turns (and many references to [*JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure))

Needless to say, I ended up going a bit overboard. 

 - The original scope of the game was a dinosaur rancher, where you can feed, collect eggs from, and sell dinosaurs.
 - The original end goal was to raise a T-Rex. 
 - In spite of this, the game I made shows the following:
   - A new menu/input system because the original system didn't have enough options to allow for targeted attacks and quests.
   - There's a quest system.
   - There are targeted attacks with a custom targeting system.
   - The map is filled with AI dinosaurs (as well as NPC stand users)
      - With a homemade pathfinding algorithm.
   - There's a shop where you can buy and sell weapons and dinosaurs/eggs. 
   - You can build fences in the world which prevent movement
   - Weapons are all custom with varied ranges and damage.
    - These are even respected and can be used by the AI enemies in the game.
   - At a certain number of turns, a boss enemy appears with the ability to stop time.
   - You can also stop time, if you try very hard.
