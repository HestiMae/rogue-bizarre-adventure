A strange dinosaur game built in a rogue-esque CLI game engine.

I made this for a unit in Object Oriented Design - It's a TUI/CLI game with a few twists and turns (and many references to [*JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure)

Needless to say, I ended up going a bit overboard. 

 - The original scope of the game was a dinosaur rancher, where you can feed, collect eggs from, and sell dinosaurs. However:
   - The map is filled with AI dinosaurs (as well as NPC stand users) with a homemade pathfinding algorithm, 
   - There's a shop where you can buy and sell weapons and dinosaurs/eggs. 
   - You can build fences in the world which prevent movement
   - Different weapons have custom damage and attack range using a custom attack targetting system
    - These are even respected and can be used by the AI enemies in the game.
   - At a certain number of turns, a boss enemy appears with the ability to stop time.
   - The overall objective of the game is to raise a T-Rex
