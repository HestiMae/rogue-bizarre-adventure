Additions!
- Floors and walls can be built/destroyed by the player. Destroying them is just building dirt (Sneaky!).
- World has been subclassed to allow for a welcome screen to be displayed. Enemy spawning is also now possible
- An enemy has been added, DIO (I know we're supposed to use mixed case but his name is all caps in the show I am referencing)
, who appears after a set number of turns and chases (and attacks) the player. He will despawn after a time, too.
- A new move action has been added, ApproachAction, which generates a move that will take the actor 1 step closer to the target.
- Inside of the Util class, for now there is only 1 method, which calculates distance taking into account there is diagonal movement.

Many of the names of things are references to the anime JoJos Bizarre Adventure, like our project name, Robyns Bizarre Adventure.
In particular, Stardust Crusaders, part 3 of the anime, is referenced. This is why the World subclass is called ZaWarudo.
